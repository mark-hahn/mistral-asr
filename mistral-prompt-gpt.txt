adapt the script to optionally read a whole folder of videos and always auto-segment >15-min items and merge SRTs.  Process only video files with .mp4, .mkv, or .avi extensions.  For each video output a file in the same directory using the same name except for replacing the suffix with .enh.srt.  an example is converting /path/video.mkv to /path/video.enh.srt. so no ouput param is needed. If the input filename ends with .mp4, .mkv, or .avi then process only that file.  Otherwise treat the input as a path to a folder containing all the files to convert.  If the folder already has  the output file for a video then skip that video so there are no duplicates generated. Also append to a single log file in the folder detailing the conversion.  Also report progress to console.
