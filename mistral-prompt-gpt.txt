adapt the script to optionally read a whole folder of videos and always auto-segment >15-min items and merge SRTs.  Process only video files with .mp4, .mkv, or .avi extensions.  For each video output a file in the same directory using the same name except for replacing the suffix with .enh.srt.  an example is converting /path/video.mkv to /path/video.enh.srt. so no ouput param is needed. If the input filename ends with .mp4, .mkv, or .avi then process only that file.  Otherwise treat the input as a path to a folder containing all the files to convert.  If the folder already has  the output file for a video then skip that video so there are no duplicates generated. Also append to a single log file in the folder detailing the conversion.  Also report progress to console.
there are missing  words in the subtitles.  I want detailed debugging added.  Add a video time start option to go along with the current time duration option.  Add a --debug option that creates a second debug log in the same folder as the progress log.  The debug log should overwrite the old one in every run, not append.  Show chunk details of operation like precise timestamps of audio uploaded and params sent to api.  Show segment details of text and timestamps.  Show script logic operations like smart overlap with numbers used in smart calculation.  Insert two blank lines before chunk data and one before segment data.  all timestamps should have full precision.
