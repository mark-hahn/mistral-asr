USER: running 01_intro.ipynb in vscode notebook and i get import fastbook error module not found

ASSISTANT: That error means the Python environment your notebook kernel is using doesn’t have the fastbook package installed. Fastbook is part of the fast.ai course support library. You can install it with pip or conda:
  pip install fastbook
... [rest of explanation about installing fastbook, pip vs conda, and kernel selection] ...

USER: >pip install fastbook
Defaulting to user installation ... ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement fastbook

ASSISTANT: That looks like a network resolution error. pip can’t reach PyPI. Check your DNS and connectivity, etc. ...

USER: C:\Users\mark\apps\fastbook>ping pypi.org
Ping request could not find host pypi.org.

ASSISTANT: That confirms DNS resolution problem for pip. You can try: check proxy, use different DNS, etc. ...

USER: my dns works for all other apps

ASSISTANT: Then likely Windows Python’s pip is not picking up system DNS properly. Check hosts file, try `python -m pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org fastbook`. ...

USER: nslookup pypi.org
Server:  RT-AX86U_Pro-1420
Non-authoritative answer:
151.101.*.223

ASSISTANT: That shows DNS works at OS level. So the problem may be firewall, Python build, or IPv6 handling. You can force IPv4 with pip config. ...

USER: can a vscode rendered support asciidoc? The one I'm using (microsoft) doesn't render this snippet ...

ASSISTANT: The Microsoft AsciiDoc extension doesn’t support full Asciidoctor tables by default. Try the AsciiDoc by asciidoctor extension. ...

USER: settings.json gives error that a string is expected in this snippet: { "asciidoc.preview.style": [...] }

ASSISTANT: The correct setting key is `"asciidoc.preview.styles"` (plural). ...

USER: this gives unknown setting error: asciidoc.preview.styles

ASSISTANT: That means you might be using the `joaompinto.asciidoctor-vscode` extension, which uses slightly different settings. ...

USER: the python kernel selector shows one option which has python.undefined.undefined.undefined then a space and then the path to the python exe

ASSISTANT: That usually means your Jupyter extension can’t find proper kernelspec metadata. Install `ipykernel`. ...

USER: jupyter kernelspec list → 'jupyter' not recognized

ASSISTANT: You need to install Jupyter into your Python environment. `pip install notebook jupyter ipykernel`. ...

USER: does the intel gpu iris xe support pytorch

ASSISTANT: Not directly with CUDA. PyTorch runs on CPU, Intel GPU support is experimental through oneAPI/IPEX. ...

USER: how do i find what gpu is in a linux server

ASSISTANT: No, only integrated Radeon 890M is inside. For NVIDIA you must use an external dock. ...

USER: can the SoC (AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370), run pytorch

ASSISTANT: Yes, CPU PyTorch runs fine. The integrated Radeon 890M is not supported by ROCm for GPU acceleration. ...

USER: give me a couple of compact OCuLink eGPU docks that are known to work with NVIDIA cards and the AI X1?

ASSISTANT: Examples: MINISFORUM DEG1 eGPU dock, GTBOX G-Dock. Both support full-size NVIDIA GPUs over OCuLink. ...

USER: recommend specs for MINISFORUM DEG1 power supply

ASSISTANT: Needs an ATX/SFX PSU. For mid-range GPUs 500–600W is fine, high-end cards need 650–750W or more. ...

USER: what type of connector does modular PSU use

ASSISTANT: Standard ATX/EPS 24-pin + 8-pin CPU, PCIe 6/8-pin or 12VHPWR for GPUs. PSU side is proprietary per vendor. ...

USER: decribe nvidia gpus with performance and price

ASSISTANT: [Assistant summarized RTX 50 series models, MSRPs, performance tiers.] ...

USER: compare performance with each gpu combined with MINISFORUM DEG1

ASSISTANT: OCuLink gives near-desktop performance with small drops: RTX 4070 Ti loses ~10%, RTX 4090 loses 16–23% depending on internal/external display. ...

USER: can vscode jupyter be used with online services? recommend service

ASSISTANT: Yes, you can point VS Code to Jupyter servers on Azure ML, Databricks, SageMaker, or JupyterHub. Recommended: Azure ML if you’re in Azure ecosystem. ...

USER: how do i use a Azure Bicep template

ASSISTANT: Install Bicep CLI, write a .bicep template, deploy with `az deployment group create`. Example given. ...

USER: do i have to use bicep to create a compute instance?

ASSISTANT: No, you can also create via portal, CLI, or Python SDK. Bicep is optional for IaC. ...

USER: do i need SSH to use compute instance with local vscode?

ASSISTANT: No, not for notebooks. VS Code Jupyter + Azure ML extension connect over AAD-secured public endpoint. SSH only needed for full remote dev. ...

USER: vscode desktop for azure machine learning is saying to Sign in to your account and tenant. but you told me i didn't need a tenant

ASSISTANT: You always have a tenant (AAD) behind your subscription, you don’t manage it manually. Just sign in with your account and select the tenant shown. ...

USER: i've opened a local fast.ai repository in vscode. How do I set it to use the azure compute instance

ASSISTANT: Option A: keep editing locally, switch kernel in notebook to Azure ML compute instance. Option B: full remote dev via SSH. ...

USER: how to create a new notebook in vscode

ASSISTANT: File → New File → save as .ipynb, or Command Palette: Jupyter: Create New Notebook. ...

USER: how to upgrade a compute instance

ASSISTANT: You can’t change size in place. Create a new compute instance with bigger SKU. In some cases you can resize if option is enabled. ...

USER: print("CUDA:", torch.cuda.is_available()) gives me local url Host: mlap1 ...

ASSISTANT: You’re still on local kernel. Switch to Azure ML compute instance kernel in VS Code. ...

USER: i switched to azure kernel and now error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'

ASSISTANT: Torch not installed on remote VM. Install with pip inside notebook. Instructions given. ...

USER: i have a cpu workspace in azure and I'm getting Host: basic-compute /anaconda/... CUDA: False — is this correct?

run it: 
python voxtral_subs.py input.mp4 --out captions.srt

Tips
If you have a GPU: add --device cuda.
For long videos, tweak --chunk 45 --stride 7 for smoother timestamps.
To embed into an MP4 after generating SRT, the script prints an ffmpeg command you can copy.
