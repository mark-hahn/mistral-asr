To check if segments are being excluded during deduplication, search the debug log for these specific patterns:

Search terms:

    "EXCLUDED:" - Shows segments that were removed

EXCLUDED: Very similar text (>80%)
EXCLUDED: Existing segment is longer/better

    "REPLACED:" - Shows when a segment replaced an existing one

REPLACED: Existing segment (current is longer)

    Deduplication summary line:

Deduplication: Result: X → Y segments (Z duplicates removed)

What to look for:

    High duplicate removal: If you see "50 duplicates removed" that might be too aggressive
    Specific phrases being excluded: Search for your known missing phrases
    Overlap percentage: Look for segments excluded with low overlap (should only exclude >70% overlap)
    Text similarity percentage: Should only exclude >80% similarity

Expected normal behavior:

    Most segments should show no deduplication messages (no significant overlaps)
    Only a few segments should be excluded, and only when they're genuine duplicates
    The deduplication summary should show a small number of duplicates removed (maybe 5-10 for a 28-minute video)

If you see many exclusions or specific phrases being removed, that indicates the deduplication logic is too aggressive.
