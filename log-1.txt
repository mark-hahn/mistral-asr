RAW: 4, [0:09:02.9], [0:09:04.7], "because they tried to save her life?"
RAW: 4, [0:09:05.5], [0:09:08.2], "Or was that all a clever cover story?"
RAW: 4, [0:09:11.5], [0:09:16.5], "It's now 25 years later, and the murder remains unsolved."
RAW: 4, [0:09:17.1], [0:09:20.7], "I'm Belle Richmond, this is Echoes, the Rosie Duff case,"
RAW: 4, [0:09:20.7], [0:09:23.6], "and I'm here to ask, why?"

RAW: 5, [0:09:28.2], [0:09:31.2], "This, this is what passes for journalism now, is it?"
RAW: 5, [0:09:31.6], [0:09:33.4], "A sultry voice and a bit of a jingle."
RAW: 5, [0:09:33.8], [0:09:37.1], "The angle seems to be that the original investigation was negligent."
RAW: 5, [0:09:37.4], [0:09:38.2], "Victim blaming."
RAW: 5, [0:09:39.2], [0:09:43.5], "That because Rosie was out by herself in the early hours, we didn't prioritise the case."
RAW: 5, [0:09:43.9], [0:09:44.5], "Well, you were there."
RAW: 5, [0:09:45.2], [0:09:45.6], "Is that true?"
RAW: 5, [0:09:45.8], [0:09:46.6], "Of course not."
RAW: 5, [0:09:47.6], [0:09:49.7], "But admittedly, it doesn't look good."
RAW: 5, [0:09:50.1], [0:09:52.1], "that we've never launched a review."
RAW: 5, [0:09:52.1], [0:09:53.7], "Because there's no new evidence."
RAW: 5, [0:09:53.7], [0:09:58.5], "We'd be going through the motions because some woke millennials found a microphone."
RAW: 5, [0:09:58.5], [0:10:01.1], "Listen, we underestimate her at a bell."
RAW: 5, [0:10:01.1], [0:10:03.3], "She gave them at hell over a missing person's case,"
RAW: 5, [0:10:03.3], [0:10:05.8], "and the chief constable doesn't want the same for us."
RAW: 5, [0:10:05.8], [0:10:07.7], "We have to stay ahead of her."
RAW: 5, [0:10:07.7], [0:10:10.6], "Right. So I've got some poor sod on it."
RAW: 5, [0:10:10.6], [0:10:13.6], "for damage control, with no hope of solving it."
RAW: 5, [0:10:13.6], [0:10:16.6], "It's good experience for a young detective."
RAW: 5, [0:10:16.6], [0:10:19.6], "And given the angle of the podcast,"
RAW: 5, [0:10:19.6], [0:10:23.2], "I think it would help the optics if it was a female officer."
RAW: 5, [0:10:25.9], [0:10:28.9], "You go with it."
RAW: 5, [0:10:39.0], [0:10:41.0], "These facts are tiny."
RAW: 5, [0:10:41.0], [0:10:44.4], "There's no way he hid 50k worth of stuff in there."
RAW: 5, [0:10:44.4], [0:10:46.3], "I see I had no idea."
RAW: 5, [0:10:46.3], [0:10:47.5], "Yeah."
RAW: 5, [0:10:47.5], [0:10:50.0], "Women should be more vigilant."
RAW: 5, [0:10:50.0], [0:10:51.2], "I know you like him, sweetheart,"
RAW: 5, [0:10:51.2], [0:10:54.2], "but you just make sure he's not hiding stolen iPads"
RAW: 5, [0:10:54.2], [0:10:55.4], "under your floorboards."
RAW: 5, [0:10:55.4], [0:10:55.9], "Right."
RAW: 5, [0:10:57.5], [0:11:00.1], "Tracy, we're just here to get your witness statement."

RAW: 5, [0:11:02.7], [0:11:03.5], "Yeah."
RAW: 5, [0:11:05.1], [0:11:05.9], "Do you need help?"
RAW: 5, [0:11:05.9], [0:11:06.7], "No, no, I'm fine."
RAW: 5, [0:11:08.2], [0:11:09.1], "What is that noise?"
RAW: 5, [0:11:10.9], [0:11:11.7], "He's here."
RAW: 5, [0:11:12.7], [0:11:13.7], "We're back together."
RAW: 5, [0:11:14.7], [0:11:15.6], "Right."


RAW: 6, [0:11:06.1], [0:11:06.9], "I'm fine."
RAW: 6, [0:11:08.2], [0:11:09.1], "What is that noise?"
RAW: 6, [0:11:10.9], [0:11:11.8], "He's here."
RAW: 6, [0:11:12.7], [0:11:13.7], "We're back together."
RAW: 6, [0:11:14.7], [0:11:15.6], "Right."
RAW: 6, [0:11:15.6], [0:11:17.6], "But he came home drunk."
RAW: 6, [0:11:17.6], [0:11:18.5], "Right."
RAW: 6, [0:11:18.5], [0:11:19.9], "So I locked him out in the balcony."
RAW: 6, [0:11:21.5], [0:11:23.5], "Right, we're coming in now, Tracy."
RAW: 6, [0:11:23.5], [0:11:24.9], "Why don't we..."
RAW: 6, [0:11:24.9], [0:11:27.3], "We need to have a chat in here."
RAW: 6, [0:11:27.3], [0:11:29.1], "I've changed my mind about testifying."
RAW: 6, [0:11:29.1], [0:11:29.9], "We need the police."
RAW: 6, [0:11:29.9], [0:11:30.4], "The police?"
RAW: 6, [0:11:30.4], [0:11:31.4], "Come inside, please."

RAW: 6, [0:11:32.4], [0:11:33.3], "We've talked about this."
RAW: 6, [0:11:33.3], [0:11:33.8], "I love him."
RAW: 6, [0:11:33.8], [0:11:35.4], "I'm not going to help you put him away."
RAW: 6, [0:11:35.4], [0:11:37.4], "You will be an accessory to his crimes, Tracy."
RAW: 6, [0:11:37.4], [0:11:38.7], "I didn't know what he was doing."
